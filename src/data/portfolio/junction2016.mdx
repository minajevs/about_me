Skype bot for fashion advices.
It processes natural language requests to search for clothes on ZALANDO web store.
You just ask him about things you need and he will find most suitable things for you.
It can understand natural human language and search by color, season, brand, gender etc.
It can also sort results by various aspects like popularity or price, and, most important - find similar items by photo!
