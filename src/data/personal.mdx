My name is **Dmitrijs Minajevs** and I am software developer and enthusiastic hacker located in RÄ«ga, Latvia.

Currently I am employed as Senior Software Engineer at [C.T.Co](https://ctco.lv/).

I enjoy playing around with technology and creating things. I am very excited about functional programming, architecture and software craftmanship.
